# intRo-Tutorials

This is a set of tutorials with the main purpose of teaching the basics of R in the `tidyverse` style as applied to Sports Analytics. The files are originally intended for members of the Sports Analytics Club at NC State so examples are geared towards those purposes. Members participating in the tutorials are expected to be Freshman or those new to programming so some topics are not covered very in depth as meetings are only 1 hour long. This may become very evident to those reading through intRo 3 and 4. 

intRo 1- Basics.R: This file includes coding basics such as data structures, data types, good commenting practices, and how to use the help function. Skills also taught are `tidyverse` functions useful for manipulating data such as `select()` and `mutate()`.

intRo 2- R Markdown.Rmd: This file is an introduction to R Markdown, primarily making PDFs with LaTeX. The tutorial describes text formatting as well as writing code in R Markdown.

intRo 3- Data and Graphing.Rmd: This 1st part of the tutorial describes how to read in data as well as very basic web scraping html tables. The 2nd parat of the tutorial is about where to find data on the internet. A lot of the data sources can be found on Brendan Kent's website https://brendankent.com/2021/03/09/free-sports-data-sources/. Finally, this tutorial introduces plotting with the `ggplot2` package by walking through the process of making a histogram with data from https://kenpom.com.

intRo 4- Modeling.R: This tutorial walks readers through fitting a Least Squares Regression modeling problem using the Lahman Datasets. This tutorial also goes through plotting the regression model in base R and using the ggplot2 package.

intRo 5- Sharing.R: This tutorial is about sharing your code and graphics. This takes users through the basics of using Github and also provides some tips on sharing your graphics on Twitter.

I want to give a special thanks to Graham Pash and Jason Thompson for creating the original intRo tutorial whose contents are spread throughout the tutorials.
